**Grammar:**

* The sentence "The wind whispered secrets in the air, carrying the memory of the ocean breeze and the stories of fishermen who had once called this place home" should be written as a compound sentence, as it contains two independent clauses.
* The phrase "Tari's eyes widened with wonder and curiosity" should be placed in parentheses, as it is a parenthetical phrase.

**Tone:**

* The tone of the passage is peaceful and contemplative, as it focuses on the beauty of the lagoon and the wonder of the young boy's presence in the scene.

**Suggestions for improvement:**

* Use more descriptive language to paint a vivid picture of the lagoon and its surroundings. For example, you could describe the shimmering waters, the lush vegetation, and the vibrant colors of the surrounding flora.
* Vary the sentence structure to create a more engaging reading experience. For example, you could use shorter sentences to create a sense of urgency, or you could use complex sentences to add depth and complexity to the writing.
* Use more figurative language, such as metaphors and similes, to add emotional depth to the passage. For example, you could compare the lagoon to a "mirror of the sky" or describe the water as "as clear as a diamond."
* Consider adding a sense of conflict or tension to the passage. For example, you could have Tari face a challenge or struggle to appreciate the beauty of the lagoon.
